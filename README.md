# Data Engineering Fundamentals

As data has grown over the last few decades, so has the demand for working with it.

"Big Data" - or, simply _data_ these days - is of no value until it produces insights. Data needs organising, combining and analysing before it can deliver any actionable suggestions.

In this course, we will look at the fundamentals of working with data in order to analyse it. We will be using the Databricks platform as we apply the fundamental tools, techniques and languages of Data Engineering.
